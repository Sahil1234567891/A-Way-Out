Stepping through, you find yourself in a dimly lit corridor. The walls are covered in strange symbols, and you can hear faint, eerie noises in the distance.*\n\nYou: (whispering) What is this place?\n\n*You continue down the corridor, and it eventually leads to a junction. To your left, there's another door, while to your right, you see a long, twisting corridor.*\n\nYou: (thinking) Which way should I go?\n\n*Not knowing what awaits you, you decide to go through the door to your left. As you open it, you find yourself in a small, circular room with multiple doors, each labeled with different symbols.*\n\nYou: (confused) Now what? Which door should I choose?");
