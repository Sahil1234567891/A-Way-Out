I haven't done anything to deserve this!\n\n*You desperately look around, trying to find any possible means of escape.* \n\nYou: (determined) I won't let you do this to me! There has to be a way out of here!\n\n???: (mocking) Determination, I see. Very well, you can try to find a way out. But be warned, my dear subject, you're not alone in this maze.\n\n*As you start exploring your surroundings, you notice a door in the far corner of the room.*\n\nYou: (whispering to yourself) Maybe that door leads to my escape.\n\n*You cautiously approach the door, and to your surprise, it creaks open. Stepping through, you find yourself in a dimly lit corridor. The walls are covered in strange symbols, and you can hear faint, eerie noises in the distance.*\n\nYou: (whispering) What is this place?\n\n*You continue down the corridor, and it eventually leads to a junction. To your left, there's another door, while to your right, you see a long, twisting corridor.*\n\nYou: (thinking) Which way should I go?\n\n*Not knowing what awaits you, you decide to go through the door to your left. As you open it, you find yourself in a small, circular room with multiple doors, each labeled with different symbols.*\n\nYou: (confused) Now what? Which door should I choose?");
